# SwatDB

SwatDB is a RDBMS used by the Computer Science Department of Swarthmore College for academic purposes. 
I collaborated with Herbie Rand on designing, building, and testing lower level components of the system, advised by 
Prof. Newhall and Prof. Soni. It is work under progress as of 2020. This repository only contains a documentation pdf 
of the public interface and those who are interested should contact the Computer Science Department of Swarthmore College.
