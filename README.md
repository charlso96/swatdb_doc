# SwatDB

SwatDB is a RDBMS that is used by the Computer Science Department of Swarthmore College for academic purposes. 
I collaborated with Herbie Rand on designing, building, and testing lower level components of the system, advised by 
Prof. Newhall and Prof. Soni. It is work under progress as of 2020. Those who are interested should contact the 
Computer Science Department of Swarthmore College. The source code of the project is copyrighted by Computer Science
